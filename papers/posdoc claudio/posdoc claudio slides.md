### **Slide 2: Context - The Cortex Project**
**Type:** Split Vertical (50/50)

**Left Column (Overview):**
*   **What is Cortex?**
    *   A disruptive knowledge management innovation for the energy sector.
    *   Developed by Petrobras in collaboration with PUC-Rio, UNESP, Infotec, and Atos.
    *   **Core Tech:** Integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with corporate databases (RAG architecture).
*   **Role:**
    *   Amplifies human expertise rather than replacing it.
    *   Transforms vast textual databases into actionable knowledge.

**Right Column (Key Stats & Domains):**
*   **Strategic Domains:**
    *   SMS (Health, Safety, Environment)
    *   Operations & Projects
    *   PD&I
    *   Compliance & Governance
*   **Performance:**
    *   **77%** accuracy in expert tests.
    *   Winner of the **Petrobras Pride Award**.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Natural language queries.
    *   Traceable answers (citations to original docs).
    *   Text-to-SQL for visual analytics.

### **Slide 3: The Challenge & Motivation**
**Type:** Single Content

**Content:**
### Why this research?

*   **The Problem:**
    *   Well construction is **knowledge-intensive** and **safety-critical**.
    *   Traditional keyword search struggles with the volume and semantic complexity of technical documents.
    *   Need for rapid, evidence-based decision-making to reduce Non-Productive Time (NPT).
*   **The Research Gap:**
    *   Most current literature focuses on **pilots** or **simulations**.
    *   Lack of rigorous, field-based evidence quantifying the **business value** of GenAI in large enterprises.
    *   Need to understand *how* AI copilots affect decision quality and risk mitigation in the real world.

### **Slide 4: Research Questions**
**Type:** Single Content

**Content:**
### Main Question
> What measurable benefits, values, performance gains, and potential risks does **Cortex** deliver to knowledge-intensive processes in Petrobras’ well construction domain?

### Secondary Questions
*   **Comparison:** How do benefits differ between **intensive users** (Contracting) and a matched **control group**?
*   **Mechanisms:** Which factors mediate these benefits? (e.g., faster retrieval, better grounding).
*   **Context:** How do governance, data freshness, and training condition the impact?
*   **Extrapolation:** Can these results be applied to other operational domains?

### **Slide 5: Theoretical Framework**
**Type:** Four Quadrants (or Split Vertical)

**Content:**
1.  **Knowledge-Based View (KBV)**
    *   Firm performance depends on creating and applying knowledge.
    *   Cortex acts as a **"Knowledge Access Amplifier."**
2.  **Socio-Technical Systems**
    *   Success requires aligning **Technology** (Cortex), **People** (Engineers), and **Process** (Workflows).
3.  **Technology Acceptance (UTAUT/TAM)**
    *   **Traceability** (citations) builds trust.
    *   Usability drives adoption.
4.  **High-Reliability Organising (HRO)**
    *   Safety depends on "managing the unexpected."
    *   Real-time access to lessons learned reduces latent errors.

### **Slide 6: Methodology - Comparative Study**
**Type:** Split Horizontal (Top: Design, Bottom: Metrics)

**Top Part (Study Design):**
*   **Setting:** Live enterprise environment at Petrobras.
*   **Treatment Group:** Contracting professionals (Intensive Cortex users).
*   **Control Group:** Matched users from adjacent sub-processes (Operations, Planning).
*   **Approach:** Mixed Methods (Quantitative + Qualitative).

**Bottom Part (Data Collection):**
*   **Surveys:** Perceived benefits, trust, adoption climate.
*   **Task Evaluation:** Standardized tasks to measure speed and quality.
*   **Analytics:** System usage logs.
*   **Interviews:** Deep dive into user experiences and use cases.

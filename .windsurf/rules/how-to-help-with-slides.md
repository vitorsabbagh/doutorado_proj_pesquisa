If the user needs help making slides (power point presentation), you should produce the exact content of each slide: bullets, texts, images, diagrams, etc.

- Type of slide (divided in the middle vertically, divided horizontaly, single content, etc)
- What goes on each part: bullets, texts, images, diagrams, etc.

Write the exact texts for each part, so the user can copy and paste.
